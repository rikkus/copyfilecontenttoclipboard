Copyright (C) 2007 Rik Hemsley <rik@rikkus.info>

Based on a sample application written by Ralph Arvesen:
http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/SimpleContextMenu.asp

This program adds an entry to the Explorer context menu for all files.

The entry reads 'Copy text content to clipboard.'

It does what it says.

If the file to be copied is larger than a limit (50MB at the time of writing
this document), a warning is given.
